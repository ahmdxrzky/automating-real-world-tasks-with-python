# Scenario
# Your company is in the process of updating its website, and they've hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site.
# But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90Â° clockwise and too large.
# Oof! You're not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast.
# You'll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.
