# Scenario
# Your company is in the process of updating its website, and they've hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site.
# But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90Â° clockwise and too large.
# Oof! You're not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast.
# You'll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.

# What I've done?
# Import some external libraries __ (1)
# Move working directory to folder that contains target files __ (2)
# Iterate through each file __ (3)
# Use try-except method to ensure only image file being opened __ (4)
# Use regex to ensure format change procedure only done to unmanipulated file __ (5)
# Manipulate image file with rotate, resize, and rename it __ (6)
# Move the file to a target folder __ (7)
