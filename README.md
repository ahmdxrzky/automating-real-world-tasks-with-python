# Automating Real-World Tasks with Python
<h3> Brief Introduction </h3>

[Google IT Automation with Python](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation) is a specialization offered by Coursera. This specialization consists of six courses, developed by Google and designed to provide IT professionals with in-demand skills, including Python, Git, and IT automation -- that can help them advance their careers. The hands-on curriculum is designed to teach learners how to write code in Python, with a special focus on how this applies to automating tasks in the world of IT support and systems administration. Those who received this certificate passed all graded assessments with a score of 80% of above. They should have a strong foundation in how to use Git and GitHub, troubleshoot and debug complex problems, and apply automation at scale by using configuration management and the Cloud in order to prepare them for more advanced IT Support Specialist or Junior Systems Administrator positions.

<h3> Final Course: Automating Real-World Tasks with Python </h3>
In the final course of this specialization, learners will tie together the concepts that theyâ€™ve learned. They'll tackle real-world scenarios in Qwiklabs that will challenge learners to use multiple skills at once. There are four projects need to be solved by learners. Scenario, algorithm, and script code for each project is attached below.
