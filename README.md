# Automating Real-World Tasks with Python
<h3> Brief Introduction </h3>

[Google IT Automation with Python](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation) is a specialization offered by Coursera. This specialization consists of six courses, developed by Google and designed to provide IT professionals with in-demand skills, including Python, Git, and IT automation -- that can help them advance their careers. The hands-on curriculum is designed to teach learners how to write code in Python, with a special focus on how this applies to automating tasks in the world of IT support and systems administration. Those who received this certificate passed all graded assessments with a score of 80% of above. They should have a strong foundation in how to use Git and GitHub, troubleshoot and debug complex problems, and apply automation at scale by using configuration management and the Cloud in order to prepare them for more advanced IT Support Specialist or Junior Systems Administrator positions.

<h3> Crash Course on Python </h3>
This course is designed to teach you the foundations in order to write simple programs in Python using the most common structures. No previous exposure to programming is needed. By the end of this course, you'll understand the benefits of programming in IT roles; be able to write simple programs using Python; figure out how the building blocks of programming fit together; and combine all of this knowledge to solve a complex programming problem. We'll start off by diving into the basics of writing a computer program. Along the way, you’ll get hands-on experience with programming concepts through interactive exercises and real-world examples. You’ll quickly start to see how computers can perform a multitude of tasks — you just have to write code that tells them what to do. <br><br>

<h3> Final Course: Automating Real-World Tasks with Python </h3>
In the final course of this specialization, learners will tie together the concepts that they’ve learned. They'll tackle real-world scenarios in Qwiklabs that will challenge learners to use multiple skills at once. There are four projects need to be solved by learners. Scenario, algorithm, and script code for each project is attached below.
