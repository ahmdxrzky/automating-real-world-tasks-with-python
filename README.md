# Automating Real-World Tasks with Python
<h3> Brief Introduction </h3>
[Google IT Automation with Python](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation) is a specialization offered by Coursera. <br>
This specialization consists of six courses, developed by Google and designed to provide IT professionals with in-demand skills, <br>
including Python, Git, and IT automation -- that can help them advance their careers. <br>
The hands-on curriculum is designed to teach learners how to write code in Python, <br>
with a special focus on how this applies to automating tasks in the world of IT support and systems administration. <br>
Those who received this certificate passed all graded assessments with a score of 80% of above. <br>
They should have a strong foundation in how to use Git and GitHub, troubleshoot and debug complex problems, and <br>
apply automation at scale by using configuration management and the Cloud in order to prepare them <br>
for more advanced IT Support Specialist or Junior Systems Administrator positions. <br>

<h3> Final Course: Automating Real-World Tasks with Python </h3>
In the final course, learners will tie together the concepts that theyâ€™ve learned up until now. <br>
They'll tackle real-world scenarios in Qwiklabs that will challenge learners to use multiple skills at once. <br>
There are four projects need to be solved by learners. <br>
Scenario, algorithm, and script code for each project is attached below. <br>
<br>

First Project: [Manipulating Images (change_format.py)](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/automating-real-world-tasks-with-python-coursera/blob/main/change_format.py) <br>
Second Project: [Interacting with Web Services (run.py)](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/automating-real-world-tasks-with-python-coursera/blob/main/run.py) <br>
Third Project: [Automatic Output Generation (cars.py)](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/automating-real-world-tasks-with-python-coursera/blob/main/cars.py) <br>
Fourth Project: [Putting it All Together](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/automating-real-world-tasks-with-python-coursera/blob/main/fourth_project.md). 
(since it's a complex project, I've refer the link above to another manual file).
