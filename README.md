# automating-real-world-tasks-with-python-coursera
This repository consists of few codes which I write as answer for each Final Project on "IT Automation with Python" module on Coursera <br>
<br>
First Project: [Manipulating Images (change_format.py)](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/automating-real-world-tasks-with-python-coursera/blob/main/change_format.py) <br>
Second Project: [Interacting with Web Services (run.py)](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/automating-real-world-tasks-with-python-coursera/blob/main/run.py) <br>
Third Project: [Automatic Output Generation (cars.py)](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/automating-real-world-tasks-with-python-coursera/blob/main/cars.py) <br>
Fourth Project: [Putting it All Together](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/automating-real-world-tasks-with-python-coursera/blob/main/fourth_project.md) <br>
For the Fourth Project, since it's a complex project, I've refer the link above to another manual file.
